# ![] StripeX
**Provides a wrapper for working with Stripe.com**

----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT 3/16/17: This works with the OLD Stripe API that worked with TSL 1.0. It will not work with the current Stripe API.  If you created your Stripe account prior to 1/1/17, this should work. If you have a newer Stripe account, this will no longer work due to Stripe's security change.
